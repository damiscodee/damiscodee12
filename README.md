### 🧐 _about Me_

I'm a **mechatronics engineering student** in my 4th year. When I'm not calculating torque or analyzing circuits, I'm deep-diving into the world of **Web3 and Blockchain development**. 

I love the intersection of hardware logic and decentralized software. My goal? To understand the nuts and bolts of machines *and* the blocks and hashes of the future internet.

- 🔭 **i’m currently working on:** Finishing my engineering degree and exploring blockchain use-cases.
- 🌱 **i’m currently learning:** Solidity, Smart Contract architecture, and Python.
- 👯 **i’m looking to collaborate on:** Open-source blockchain projects or anything where hardware meets Web3.
- 💬 **ask me about:** why my robot isn't walking yet or why I'm bullish on crypto.
- ⚡ **fun fact:** i speak fluent g-code and am learning to speak fluent EVM.
